# Project Title

Udacity Front End Nanodegree - Project 2: Landing Page


# Project Description

This project is meant to achive 3 Behavior:
1. Build navigation dynamically using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.
2. Section Active State, should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
3. When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.


### Suggestions

- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
    - Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.
- Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
- Update/change the design/content.
- Make sections collapsible.
